# Geo Data Science Blog

A Blog about Algorithms and Data Science created with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). 

- Created on the ashes of my blog about geospatial data science on [hashnode](https://geods.hashnode.dev/) and my [medium blog](https://medium.com/@sebastianof/).

- To know more about the blog, go to the "about" page.

- If you want to know more about why I moved away from medium and hashnode and why I am using quarto, you can read about it here and here.
