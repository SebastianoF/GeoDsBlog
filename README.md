# Geo Data Science Blog

A Blog about Geospatial Data Science and Algorithms created with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). 

- Created on the ashes of my blog about geospatial data science on [hashnode](https://geods.hashnode.dev/) and my [medium blog](https://medium.com/@sebastianof/).
- To start reading the blog go to [https://geospatial.netlify.app/](https://geospatial.netlify.app/)
- To know more about the blog, go to the [about](https://geospatial.netlify.app/about/about.html) page.


## Temporary disclaimer - website temporarily suspended

Due to netlify billing based on website bandwidth, and with no capping for when exceeding the free allowance, I had to temporarily suspend the service.

Soon I will be looking for alternatives and let you when the website is again available.

Thank you for your understanding.


## Blog local development

To start the server (from vscode)
```
quarto preview . --no-browser --no-watch-inputs
```
Otherwise omit the flags `--no-browser --no-watch-inputs` and open the link provided in a browser

To release, connect to netlify with the right credentials (which you should not have, unless you are me, so this line is totally useless here, except for me to remember where to find my dashboard):
```
https://app.netlify.com/sites/geospatial/overview
```
