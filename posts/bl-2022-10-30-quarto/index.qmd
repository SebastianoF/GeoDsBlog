A couple of months ago I transitioned my newly clreated blog from medium to Hashnode and I thought there was no better option!

Then, after talking about some issues in LaTeX formatting and jupyter notebook conversion to markdown with [Maxime Labonne](https://mlabonne.github.io/blog/) (also documented [here](https://geods.hashnode.dev/medium-to-hashnode)), Maxime suggested me to give [quarto](https://quarto.org/) a try.

In this post you will find some tips about how to create your blog with [quarto](https://quarto.org/) and why of the three options that I have tried so far, quarto is by far the best one.

## Pre-requisites

Unlike with medium where it is not needed, and with hashnode where you can not know, it is not possible to start a blog with quarto without any familiarity with command line and git. 

If you are here and  are new to you then it may be too early to start using with quarto.

If you have any 

My favourite learning resources, and the one I recommend most often to friends, family and students are from the [Learn enough](https://www.learnenough.com/) series, - [Learn enough git to be dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial) and [Learn enough command line to be dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial).
