An angle that would be close to 45 degrees in the spherical model (point $B_2$, $r = R$) would shrink on an elongated spherical model (point $B_1$, $r >> R$), and would become close to 90 degrees on a flattened model (point $B_3$, $r << R$). We also compare the cosine formula and the ellipsoid formula with WGS84 parameters."
