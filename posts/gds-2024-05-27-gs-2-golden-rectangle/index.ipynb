As the General System startup adventure is coming to an end, and the website may no longer be maintained, I keep it live on my personal blog. Here I could expand the article with the code embeddings that I could not add on the original version, and a more in depth-classification will be added.\n",

    "- The second group, Y (Yelllow) arrives shortly afterwards at the Cordusio tube station Cordusio, line 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a short walk from the tube station, both groups merge on the Via DelL'Orso and head East together before splitting around Teatro La Scala.  They meet again on Via Manzoni for another tandem walk to the first shop. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first shop, they split again. Group G walks southwards to visit a couple of shops, while group Y continues along via Manzoni to their next shop. Group G and Y regather for a visit to the last shop and finally head towards the Metro.  Group G returns to Lanza tube station, while group Y heads for nearby Turati tube station on Line 3.\n",

    "## Finding dwells\n",
    "‍\n",
    "\n",
    "To mine significant information from the data, such as what shops were visited throughout the afternoon, we calculate where each group has dwelled using the dwell calculator algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we define a dwell as a location of radius 15 metres, where a device (or a group of devices) has remained for more than 10 minutes.  The algorithm also takes the outliers into account and removes them from the dwell detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm returns a vector of labels, a vector of exceptions, and a table of geometries and time intervals where the dwells have occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the map, we can show the dwell geometries as ellipses after performing a Principle Component Analysis (PCA) on the pings that have been labelled as a dwell, or as a convex hull or a concave hull.\n",
    "‍\n",
    "\n",
    "‍![](images/dwells-pca.png)‍  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the number of pings in this example, the ellipses representation provides a reasonable representation of the dwell's geometry, though there are other options. Below, we also show a visualisation of the concave hull, whose outline helps us understand how the pings are spread out around the centre of the visit. \n",

    "\n",
    "‍![](images/dwells-concave-hull.png)‍  \n",
    "\n",
    "‍\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the algorithm response with the ground truth we can see that all the dwells are correctly identified. We can see where both groups have dwelled as well where each group dwelled individually."

    "## Finding co-locations\n",
    "\n",
    "Intersecting the geometries and time intervals of the dwells for the two groups provides the co-dwells, though this would not be informative enough if we also wanted to investigate where the two groups have been co-travelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "These more generic features, called co-locations, are the locations and time intervals where the devices have met, both in a static setting and in a dynamic setting.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "‍![](images/co-locations-time-intervals.png)‍  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the second co-location (second block of the first row), we can see that 10 minutes are spent together, without moving, in the same location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, group Y visits another shop for about 30 minutes, while group G dwells for 25 minutes. We can see they are not in the same location, as the co-location algorithm has not detected joint activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "‍\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for the last co-location, both groups are static for about 10 minutes. "
