#### Welcome to my blog,

I'm Sebastiano Ferraris, a senior data scientist at [Kpler](https://www.kpler.com/company/about-us), one of the most exciting data-driven global trade intelligence scale-up on the planet!

At Kpler I am part of the Risk and Compliance team where I work and learn with top notch analysts, developers and researchers.

In my spare time I like to brush up the basics and explore a range of topics in geospatial data science. 

Sometimes the results of these explorations can become blog post in the personal blog you are reading right now.

Here you will find some tutorials and small research projects about [geospatial data science](https://carto.com/what-is-spatial-data-science) with particular focus on algorithms, mathematics and coding practices.

All my posts are aimed at be as *practical* and *hands-on* as possible, so as to give you the possibility of reproducing all that is shown.

The blog is created with with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and deployed on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/SebastianoF/GeoDsBlog).

If you want to get in touch, please [drop me an email](mailto:sebastiano.ferraris@gmail.com), or connect on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibis-redibis/). I am nowhere to be found on X, Facebook, Instagram or other social networks, as I can get distracted very easily already without their help.

Also on this blog you can find two versions of my CV:

- [One for humans](https://sebastianof.github.io/GeoDsBlog/about/CV_for_humans/curriculum.pdf) it looks interesting and it is not Applicant Tracking Systems compatible.
- [One for machines](https://sebastianof.github.io/GeoDsBlog/about/CV_for_machines/curriculum.docx.pdf) it looks dull and is ATS compatible.


#### Feedback

There are no public comment sections. This is a deliberate choice, as I can not commit to their moderation with enough consistency. 

Nonetheless any comment, suggestion and feedback you would like to share with me, postive or negative is very welcome. Please drop me an email (you can find it on my [github](https://github.com/SebastianoF) profile). I do not guarantee to answer in short time, though I promise to do all what I can to answer to you in due course.
