# About

Welcome, I'm Sebastiano Ferraris, data scientist at [General System](https://generalsystem.com/), and this is my blog about Geospatial Data Science.

Here I am sharing some tutorials and small projects about geospatial data science with particular focus on algorithms, mathematics and coding practices.

All my posts are aimed at be as practical and hands-on as possible, so as to give you the possibility of reproducing all that is shown.

I've been working in algorithms development and data analysis for more than 10 years in a range of industries, from automotive, to medical imaging to hospitality industry. 
Now at General System I work and learn with a great team of scientists and engineers how to tackle the challenges posed by geospatial sensor data processing at large scale.

When not processing data or developing algorithms I can be found running somewhere possibly muddy, or playing an old classical guitar, or holding down the fort for my family.


You can find more on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibis-redibis/) and my open source projects on [github](https://github.com/SebastianoF). You will certainly not find me on twitter!

This blog started on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sebastianof), then moved to [hashnode](https://geods.hashnode.dev/) to finally land to Quarto. 
The source code is available on [github](https://github.com/SebastianoF/GeoDsBlog), where you can find the code resources, images, jupyter notebooks and more.
