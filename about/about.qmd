#### Welcome to my blog,

I'm Sebastiano Ferraris, data scientist at [General System](https://generalsystem.com/), and this is my personal blog about Geospatial Data Science.

Here I am sharing some tutorials and small projects about [geospatial data science](https://carto.com/what-is-spatial-data-science) with particular focus on algorithms, mathematics and coding practices.

All my posts are aimed at be as *practical* and *hands-on* as possible, so as to give you the possibility of reproducing all that is shown.

The blog you are reading is made with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and deployed on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/SebastianoF/GeoDsBlog).

If you want to get in touch, please [drop me an email](mailto:sebastiano.ferraris@gmail.com), or connect on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibis-redibis/). I am nowhere to be found on X, Facebook, Instagram or other social networks.

You can also find two versions of my CV:

- [One for humans](https://sebastianof.github.io/GeoDsBlog/about/CV_for_humans/curriculum.pdf) it looks interesting and it is not Applicant Tracking Systems compatible.
- [One for machines](https://sebastianof.github.io/GeoDsBlog/about/CV_for_machines/curriculum.docx.pdf) it looks dull and is ATS compatible.
