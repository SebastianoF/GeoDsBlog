#### Welcome to my blog,

I'm Sebastiano Ferraris, data scientist at [General System](https://generalsystem.com/), and this is my personal blog about Geospatial Data Science.

Here I am sharing some tutorials and small projects about [geospatial data science](https://carto.com/what-is-spatial-data-science) with particular focus on algorithms, mathematics and coding practices.

All my posts are aimed at be as *practical* and *hands-on* as possible, so as to give you the possibility of reproducing all that is shown.

The blog you are reading started on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sebastianof), then moved to [hashnode](https://geods.hashnode.dev/), to [netlify](https://geods.netlify.com/) (now defunct) to finally land to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
